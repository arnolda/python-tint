tint - friendly color normalization
===================================

`tint` helps you getting a sRBG-Value out of a color description string you happen
to stumble upon, as well as getting the best color name for any sRBG value you might
feed it with. Combined, these two functionalities enable you to narrow any color string
down to a well defined set of colors.
